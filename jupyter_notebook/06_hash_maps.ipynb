    "### Map\n",
    "- a relationship between two pieces of information where each input (key) corresponds to exactly one output (value)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key points:\n",
    "- Unique keys: Each key can only be associated with one value.\n",
    "- Not necessarily a two-way relationship: A map might not be reversible. For example, multiple people can have the same eye color, so a map from python_classes.people to eye color might not be a map from python_classes.eye color to people.\n",
    "\n",

    "- People to their heights\n",
    "- Baseball players to their batting averages\n",
    "- Placemats to the people seated at them\n",

    "### Hash Map\n",
    "- a data structure used to store key-value pairs\n",
    "- employ a hashing function to overcome a challenge to efficiently find the value associated with a given key\n",
    "- built on top of an array using a special indexing system.\n",
    "- key-value storage with fast assignments and lookup.\n",
    "- a table that represents a map from python_classes.a set of keys to a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "- Hash Function: A function that maps input data to a numerical value.\n",
    "- Hash Code: The numerical value generated by a hash function.\n",
    "- Array: A data structure used to store elements at specific indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hashing Function\n",
    "- A hashing function takes a key as input and produces a number, known as a hash code. \n",
    "- This hash code is then used as an index to store the corresponding value in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Hash Functions Work:\n",
    "- Hashing: The hash function processes the input key and generates a hash code.\n",
    "- Modulus Operation: The hash code is divided by the array size, and the remainder is used as the index.\n",
    "- Storage: The value associated with the key is stored at the calculated index in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Hash Functions Are Not Reversible:\n",
    "- Data Loss: Hash functions often involve reducing the size of the input data, leading to loss of information.\n",
    "- Security: Non-reversibility is essential for cryptographic hash functions used in security applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Example:\n",
    "1) Consider a hash map storing the astrological signs of friends:\n",
    "    - Key: Friend's name (e.g., \"Joan McNeil\")\n",
    "    - Value: Astrological sign (e.g., \"Libra\")\n",
    "    - Hashing: Apply a hashing function to \"Joan McNeil\" to get a hash code, say 17.\n",
    "    - Indexing: Use 17 as the index to store \"Libra\" in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Designing Hash Functions:\n",
    "    - Vowel Count: Add up the number of vowels in the key.\n",
    "    - Letter Values: Assign values to letters (A=1, B=2, etc.) and sum them.\n",
    "    - Custom Functions: Create specific functions for different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e.,\n",
    "Key: test\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashed Into ['t', 'e', 's', 't']\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Point ['116', '101', '115', '116']\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Add Them Up \n",
    "116 + 101 + 115 + 116 = 448 (Hash Value)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- Hash maps are efficient for storing and retrieving data based on keys.\n",
    "- Hash functions are crucial for mapping keys to array indices.\n",
    "- Effective hash functions minimize collisions (multiple keys mapping to the same index)\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Collision:\n",
    "- Collision: When two different keys produce the same hash code, it's called a collision.\n",
    "- Collision Handling: Hash maps employ strategies like separate chaining or open addressing to handle collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Separate Chaining in Hash Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "- a technique used to handle collisions in hash maps\n",
    "- When two or more keys hash to the same index, instead of overwriting the existing value, a linked list is created at that index\n",
    "- Each node in the linked list stores a key-value pair\n",
    "- important to choose a good hash function to minimize collisions and maintain efficient performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How it works:\n",
    "- Hashing: The key is hashed to obtain a hash code.\n",
    "- Indexing: The hash code is mapped to an index in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Collision Handling:\n",
    "- Empty Index: A new linked list is created at that index with the key-value pair.\n",
    "- Non-Empty Index: The key-value pair is added to the existing linked list at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "< Advantages >\n",
    "- Efficient Handling of Collisions: By using linked lists, separate chaining can handle collisions gracefully, even when multiple keys hash to the same index.\n",
    "- Good Average-Case Performance: In most cases, the hash function distributes keys evenly, resulting in efficient lookups and insertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "< Disadvantages >\n",
    "- Worst-Case Performance: In the worst-case scenario, where all keys hash to the same index, the hash map degenerates into a linked list, leading to linear search time complexity for operations.\n",
    "- Space Overhead: Separate chaining requires additional space for linked list nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Saving Keys for Hash Collision Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In hash maps, collisions can occur when two different keys produce the same hash code. To address this, a common technique is separate chaining. This involves storing colliding key-value pairs in a linked list at the corresponding array index.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Save Keys?\n",
    "- Disambiguation: By saving both the key and the value, we can distinguish between different key-value pairs that might have the same hash code.\n",
    "- Accurate Retrieval: When retrieving a value, we can compare the provided key with the saved keys in the linked list to ensure we get the correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Process of Reading or Writing\n",
    "1. Hash Calculation: Calculate the hash code for the given key.\n",
    "2. Index Determination: Use the hash code to determine the appropriate array index.\n",
    "3. Linked List Iteration: Traverse the linked list at the specified index.\n",
    "4. Key Comparison: Compare the saved key with the provided key.\n",
    "5. Value Retrieval or Update: If the keys match, retrieve or update the value. Otherwise, continue iterating.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Addressing: Linear Probing\n",
    "- another strategy to handle hash collisions in hash maps\n",
    "- Instead of using linked lists, it involves searching for an empty slot in the array to store the colliding key-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Linear Probing:\n",
    "- technique within open addressing is linear probing. How it works:\n",
    "    1. Hash Calculation: Calculate the hash code for the key.\n",
    "    2. Index Determination: Use the hash code to determine the initial index in the array.\n",
    "    3. Slot Check: If the slot is empty, insert the key-value pair.\n",
    "    4. Collision Handling: If the slot is occupied, probe the next slot in a linear sequence until an empty slot is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "- Consider a hash map to store famous horses and their owners:\n",
    "Key: Horse's name (e.g., \"Bucephalus\", \"Seabiscuit\")\n",
    "Value: Owner's name (e.g., \"Alexander the Great\", \"Charles Howard\")\n",
    "Hashing \"Bucephalus\": Hash function returns index 3.\n",
    "Storing \"Bucephalus\": Store \"Bucephalus\" and \"Alexander the Great\" at index 3.\n",
    "Hashing \"Seabiscuit\": Hash function also returns index 3 (collision).\n",
    "Linear Probing: Since index 3 is occupied, probe to index 4, which is empty.\n",
    "Storing \"Seabiscuit\": Store \"Seabiscuit\" and \"Charles Howard\" at index 4.\n",
    "Retrieving a Value:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash Calculation: Calculate the hash code for the key (\"Seabiscuit\").\n",
    "Index Determination: Determine the initial index (3).\n",
    "Slot Check:\n",
    "Index 3: Key mismatch (\"Bucephalus\" ≠ \"Seabiscuit\").\n",
    "Index 4: Key match (\"Seabiscuit\" = \"Seabiscuit\").\n",
    "Value Retrieval: Retrieve \"Charles Howard\" from python_classes.index 4.\n",
    "By using linear probing, we can efficiently handle collisions and store key-value pairs within the array itself.\n",
