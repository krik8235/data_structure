    "- process of finding the shortest path between two points in a graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Two key pathfinding algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm:\n",
    "- Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.\n",
    "- Works by iteratively selecting the vertex with the minimum distance and exploring its neighbors.\n",
    "- Time complexity: O((V+E) log V) - (ref. #17)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. A* Algorithm:\n",
    "- A modification of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance to the goal\n",
    "\n",
    "- a greedy algo using heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the goal from a given node\n",
    "- always expands the node with the lowest estimated total cost (f-score)\n",
    "    - f-score = the cost to reach the node (g-score) + the estimated cost to the goal (h-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The greedy algo approach guides the search towards the goal more efficiently than Dijkstra's algo in many cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time complexity: O(bd)\n",
    "    - b: the branching factor\n",
    "    - d: depth of the goal\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Cf. Dijkstra: O((V+E) log V) - influenced by the vertices and edges that we will not visit\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Real-world Application:\n",
    "- games\n",
    "- GPS navigation systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dijkstra vs A*\n",
    "- Case: flight route in the US. A* is better solution.\n",
    "    1. Dijkstra's approach\n",
    "    - <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfeirxlea/image/upload/t_w240_h_auto/v1730311956/lec_data_structure/vnj3egnfe2yeekmvrset.png\">\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dijkstra's algorithm is particularly useful when we want to find the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in the graph. In contrast, A* is more efficient when we have a specific target node and want to find the shortest path to that node. Â  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "- Dijkstra's algorithm can be inefficient for single-source, single-destination problems as it explores all vertices.\n",
    "- A* algorithm is more efficient by focusing on paths that are likely to lead to the goal.\n",
    "- The choice of heuristic function can significantly impact the performance of A*.\n",
    "- Both algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science and have applications in various fields."
