    "    - In weighted graphs, the value represents the edge's weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjacency List: A list of vertices, each with a list of its adjacent vertices. This representation is often more efficient for sparse graphs (graphs with fewer edges).\n",

    "    - Explores one path all the way to its end before backtracking and trying another path\n",
    "    - useful for finding if a path exists.\n",
    "    - Implementation: Uses a stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out) or recursion to keep track of the current path.\n",

    "- Breadth-First Search (BFS):\n",
    "    - Explores all neighboring vertices at a current level before moving to the next level. Efficient for finding the shortest path between two points.\n",
    "    - Implementation: Uses a queue (FIFO - First In, First Out) to keep track of unvisited neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Concepts:\n",
    "- Visited List: Keeps track of visited vertices to avoid infinite loops in cycles.\n",
    "- Runtime: O(vertices + edges) in the worst case scenario (visiting everything).\n",
    "- Traversal Orders (DFS):\n",
    "    - Pre-order: Visit vertex, then neighbors.\n",
    "    - Post-order: Visit neighbors, then vertex.\n",
    "    - Reverse Post-order (Topological Sort): Reverse of post-order.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Choosing the Right Algorithm:\n",
    "- Use DFS to determine if a path exists.\n",
    "- Use BFS to find the shortest path between two points. i.e., GPS system to find the best path from location A to B\n",
