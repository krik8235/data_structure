    "\n",
    "- a specialized binary tree-based data structure that maintains the heap property\n",
    "- the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children\n",
    "- ensures that the root node always holds the maximum value in the heap.\n",

    "#### Key Properties:\n",
    "- Max-Heap Property: Parent nodes are always greater than or equal to their children.\n",
    "- Complete Binary Tree: All levels of the tree are filled, except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Operations:\n",
    "1. Insertion: Add a new element to the end of the heap and then heapify up to restore the heap property.\n",
    "2. Deletion: Remove the root node (maximum value) and replace it with the last element. Then, heapify down to maintain the heap property.\n",

    "#### Implementation:\n",
    "- use an array\n",
    "- The array indices correspond to the nodes in the binary tree.\n",

    "### Heapsort\n",
    "- an efficient sorting algorithm that leverages the properties of a heap data structure and sorts the input list in ascending order.\n",
    "- provides a reliable and predictable performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "1. Build a Max-Heap\n",
    "    - Create a max-heap from the unsorted array.\n",
    "    - In a max-heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extract-Max\n",
    "    - Remove the root element (the maximum value) from the heap.\n",
    "    - Replace the root with the last element in the heap.\n",
    "    - Heapify down: Compare the new root with its children and swap it with the larger child until the heap property is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat:\n",
    "    - Repeat the extract-max process until the heap is empty.\n",
    "    - The extracted elements will be in descending order.\n",
    "    - To get the sorted array in ascending order, simply reverse the extracted elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "given input: [12, 18, 8, 4, 2] ->>> [2, 4, 8, 12, 18] (Heapsort rearrange the values in ascending order)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- O(n log n): This is the average and worst-case time complexity.\n",
    "- Best-case: O(n log n), even in the best case, heapsort maintains its O(n log n) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- O(1): Heapsort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires minimal extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "- Efficient: O(n log n) time complexity for all cases.\n",
    "- In-place: Requires minimal extra space.\n",
    "- Simple to Implement: The core idea is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Not Stable: The relative order of equal elements may not be preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
